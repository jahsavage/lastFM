"# lastFM" 

This was a very time consuming task but I've managed to put together a basic solution which works but certainly requires refinement.
For example errors are not reported just logged and an indication needs need provided for when no matches are found.
Also the search type radio buttons would be more helpful at the top of the screen rather than on the menu.

The returned LastFM information is nothing like as rich as discogs so might make sence to look at using additional API to provide 
and interesting display.


Tests
-----
I've provided API integration tests in Kotlin and Java to show off how to use Dagger components for testing
There are also some units tests althought not enough otherwise this task would be nowhere near displaying data

How To Build
-------------
Clone git project and build in Android Studio
